# 🌟 **Cheers!** 👋 **I'm Nirupam / Niv** 🚀  

### I am a mathematics and physics undergraduate international student at the _University of Southern Mississippi_. 
> _Exploring the intersection of **technology**, **mathematics**, and **innovation**._

Currently, I am engaged in research simulating fluid dynamics using a collocation schema known as Local Method for Approximate Particular Solutions (LMAPS), under the supervision of Dr. Huiquing Zhu. I am also involved in a number of open-source initiatives you can find below that were launched as of Febuary 2025 and have rapidly developing ecosystems. 

Previously, I worked on investigating brachistochrone curve solutions in hyperbolic space using the Poincaré and flat-chart metrics, a set of differential equations describing the geodesics in these respective metric spaces, under the supervision of Dr. Sungwook Lee.

I hope to attend graduate school and eventually enter academia in both teaching and research capacities. I aspire to work in quantum information theory, differential geometry and topology, and category theory. My ambition is to bridge the gap between the world around us and our ability to articulate its complexities fluently.

In my leisure, I enjoy exploring concepts beyond mathematics, with interests in metaphysics, deontology, psychoanalysis, sociology, and literature. I also indulge my creative interests in poetry, art, and adventure sports.
